    Represents a Composition, which is essentially a {element:amount} mapping
    type. Composition is written to be immutable and hashable,
    unlike a standard Python dict.

    Note that the key can be either an Element or a Specie. Elements and Specie
    are treated differently. i.e., a Fe2+ is not the same as a Fe3+ Specie and
    would be put in separate keys. This differentiation is deliberate to
    support using Composition to determine the fraction of a particular Specie.

    Works almost completely like a standard python dictionary, except that
    __getitem__ is overridden to return 0 when an element is not found.
    (somewhat like a defaultdict, except it is immutable).

    Also adds more convenience methods relevant to compositions, e.g.,
    get_fraction.

    It should also be noted that many Composition related functionality takes
    in a standard string as a convenient input. For example,
    even though the internal representation of a Fe2O3 composition is
    {Element("Fe"): 2, Element("O"): 3}, you can obtain the amount of Fe
    simply by comp["Fe"] instead of the more verbose comp[Element("Fe")].
